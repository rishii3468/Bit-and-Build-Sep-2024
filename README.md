## Overview

*ClosetCraft* is a dynamic clothes and accessories management website that allows users to effectively manage their wardrobe and make decisions about old or small clothes. Designed to enhance organization and fashion planning, the website offers features such as wardrobe creation, outfit suggestions, and cleanup assistance for old or small garments.

This project was created as part of our first hackathon, where we aimed to build a solution that helps users maintain their wardrobe more efficiently while promoting sustainability by encouraging the reuse and donation of old clothes. We thoroughly enjoyed building this project and learned a lot during the process.

## Features

1. *Wardrobe Creation:*
   - Users can create their own wardrobe by adding clothing items and accessories.
   - The information about each item (e.g., name, type, date of purchase) is stored and managed within the website.

2. *Outfit of the Day:*
   - The website provides a daily trendy outfit suggestion based on the user's wardrobe.
   - Users can change the outfit of the day as desired, allowing flexibility and control over their styling choices.

3. *Wardrobe Cleanup:*
   - There is a dedicated section to help users identify old clothes (based on the date of purchase) and small clothes.
   - This feature encourages users to donate or trade old clothes that are no longer in use.

4. *Sustainability Solutions:*
   - For old clothes, the website suggests donating to a nearby orphanage or trading with others, promoting sustainable wardrobe management.
